# Spotify clone - Learning project.

This is a project used for learning purposes. Goal is to build an spotify-like structure to practice Django, Django Rest Framework and React to understand better these technologies in a practical way.

## Project structure

Project follows a typical Django project structure with the frontend built using React. Main technologies and components:

backend: Directory that contains the **Django** project setup, configuration files, including the settings, URL routing, database models and **Django Rest Framework**, support files such as views and endpoint urls.

frontend: This directory contains the **React** application code, including the components, styles **(made with Tailwind css)**, and assets. Frontend was built with the help of Vite, React router, React redux among other useful tools.
